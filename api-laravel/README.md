# API Laravel (Placeholder)

This directory is reserved for a future Laravel-based API service.  In
this scaffold it remains empty to focus on the frontâ€‘end implementation.
When you are ready to add an API, you can initialize a new Laravel
project here and expose JSON endpoints consumed by the React app in
`web/`.
